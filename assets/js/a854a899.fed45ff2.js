The application will feature a back end that creates several agents (writers) capable of generating unique stories based on user prompts.

The context will be saved and used to create more complete narratives over time. This approach enables users to rely on AI agents instead of outsourcing to traditional writers, facilitating quicker story creation and providing outlines and templates for writers to build upon.
