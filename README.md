## Project Abstract

This document proposes a web application in which AI-agents interact with each other to flesh out a prompt given by the user.

## High Level Requirement

This is a web application that users can use to create a story. It can create many AI-agents that acts as authors that the user gives them and tell them to write out a full story based on a prompt or genre given to them. They will create their version, vote for the best, critique the work, make a goal, and continue to write the story. This process will repeat until the final draft of the story is written. User have the chance to veto the decisions as well as have input during the progression of the story.

## Conceptual Design


## Background

Proper citation of sources is required. If there are similar open-source products, you should state whether existing source will be used and to what extent. If there are similar closed-source/proprietary products, you should state how the proposed product will be similar and different.
