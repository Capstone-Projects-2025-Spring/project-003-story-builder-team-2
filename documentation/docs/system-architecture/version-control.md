# Version Control
We will use Git for version control in Story Builder.

To keep development organized and make bug fixing easier, we will use different branches for:

Front-End – User interface and design
Back-End – Server-side logic
Database – Data management
Testing – Bug fixes and quality checks
Production – Final stable version
This approach allows us to work smoothly and merge changes efficiently while keeping the project stable.
