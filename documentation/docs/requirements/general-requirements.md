# General Requirements
Story Builder is a web application that will be accessible through any web browser with an internet connection. Users will be required to have an internet connection and a compatible web browser installed on their device. Since Story Builder relies on user input for story prompt and voting, users should have basic grammars skills and be proficient in reading and language.

***- make the General Requirements more specific***
    
    ***- i.e. what version of browser you run on***
    
    ***- if it's on web application, is there a specific supported language, etc.***
