# Features and Requirements

## Functional Requirements

* When opening the application, the user will see a screen asking them to enter an email and a password. The email and password will be saved to a database. The user can login again later with their credentials. 
  ** Users must login in to use the service and to store their stories within their accounts.
* After logging in, the user is directed to a new page where there are options to create a new story or read previous ones.
* If the user selects create a new story, they will be directed to a new page where they can select AI agents that will be used to write a story. Each agent will have a brief description of their writing style.
* After agents are selected, the user will be asked to prompt the agents with key details of the story in a text box. 
*	The agents can write stories based on the prompt and in their own style. Only one chapter is written at a time. After a chapter is written, a voting process begins. 
*	The agents vote on which agent’s chapter they like the most.
*	The user can veto the chosen chapter and pick a different agent’s chapter.
